# Front end Engineer Challenge Q1

## 1. About you

**Tell us about one of your commercial projects with Vue.js or AngularJS.**

I have worked commercially with Vue.js for around 3 years. Having co-founded and being in charge of Front-end development in a web agency, all FE and Vue have been handled or overseen by me.

We have had numerous and various projects including informative websites, complex web applications, e-commerce projects, widgets (like calculators and banners) and a couple of web 'games'.

Vue was gradually implemented in every project to the point where it was the norm even for non-SPA websites, which actually were the majority. We combined Vue with Laravel Backend for websites, web apps and online stores.

I understand that you asked for me to discuss a single project but due to us using Vue in all of our projects I cannot pinpoint a single most significant one.
