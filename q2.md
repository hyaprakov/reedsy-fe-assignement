# Front end Engineer Challenge Q2

## 2. General

#### 2.1. What kind of front end projects do you enjoy working on? Why?

I stared FE dev when JS wasn't so dominant, before the emergence of the frameworks when JQuery was the bomb. So I can say that I enjoy (and believe to be quite skilled at) utilising all the power of CSS as a means for styling. Having an affinity for design also helps and makes it even more interesting.

And when the Front*ender became a JS FE Engineer, I hopped on that train as well, delving into the world of programming. Having knowledge of Backend / MVC / REST architecture as well and JS being the amazing abomination that it is, FE JS Api based programming is something I sincerely enjoy as well and has become an integral part of my work.

I adore working with Vue.js because it allows me to employ both sides of FE to the fullest and in the most convenient and elegant way for me. I can have full control of structure, styling and programming logic and also supplement each other in a way that other js frameworks have not given me this much joy.

Again, I cannot pinpoint what specific kind of FE projects I like working on. I can say that I enjoy working both on styling and on pure programming.
 
#### 2.2. Which are your favourite features of HTML5? How have you used them before?

Semantic tags have been the most noticeable addition and are pretty neat, I always try to employ them as good as possible.

Everything form and input related has been amazing and used extensively.

Local Storage was revolutionary and a great alternative/supplement to cookies especially when dealing with a SPA.

The Canvas also opened a new era, however, I have not used it that much.

My favourite feature is the new Doctype, plain and simple declaration, bliss.

#### 2.3. Explain the difference between creating a DOM element setting `innerHTML` and using `createElement`.

Both can be used for the essentially same goal - adding new element/s to the DOM. However, `createElement` provides better performance due to the fact that it preserves existing references to DOM elements and event handlers, as opposed to `innerHTML` which forces the browser to reparse and recreate all dom nodes.

#### 2.4. Compare two-way data binding vs one-way data flow.

I am currently using React for a project and one-way forms are a pain in the ass when coming from Vue/Angular.

In essence, two-way data binding is nothing more than both a property binding (to the value property) to populate the property from a js function and an event binding (to the input event) that calls a function. It's a way for a child component to update its parent. 

Two-way binding is useful when you want immediate propagation of the changes and the certainty that all data changed is the same. 

One-way data flow can achieve this easily, but it has do be done manually. That way you have control over DOM render cycles because sometimes you do not need this two-way update.

#### 2.5. Why is asynchronous programming important in JavaScript?

It is a key aspect in SPAs (and for JS functionality in general, but most notably noticed for api calls). It provides the opportunity for code to continue execution without the need to wait for the completion of certain functions. It essentially lets you do multiple things at ones.
